## Chapter 1: The Intel i7 CPU: Datapath and Internals

Intel's Core i7 processors are a series of high-performance CPUs designed for desktop and mobile computing, leveraging a complex microarchitecture to achieve high instruction throughput and efficient data processing. While specific details can vary between generations (e.g., Nehalem, Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell, Skylake, Coffee Lake, Raptor Lake, etc.), the fundamental principles of their datapath and internal operation remain consistent.

### 1.1 Core Microarchitecture Overview

An Intel i7 CPU typically comprises multiple physical cores, often enabled with Intel Hyper-Threading Technology (Intel HT Technology) to present more logical cores to the operating system. These cores share a large Last Level Cache (LLC), commonly known as L3 cache, and communicate via a high-speed interconnect like the Ring Bus or Mesh Interconnect (in newer architectures). Each core possesses its own private L1 and L2 caches.

The core microarchitecture is highly pipelined and superscalar, meaning it can execute multiple instructions in parallel and process them through various stages concurrently. It also employs out-of-order execution, speculative execution, and advanced branch prediction to maximize performance.

### 1.2 Instruction Pipeline and Execution Units

The Intel i7's pipeline is designed for high throughput. A simplified view of the pipeline stages includes:

1.  **Front-End:**
    * **Instruction Fetch (IF):** Fetches instructions from the L1 Instruction Cache (L1i). Advanced branch predictors (see 1.2.1) are crucial here to avoid pipeline stalls from mispredicted branches. The i7 fetches multiple instruction bytes per cycle from the 64-byte cache line.
    * **Pre-decode Buffer & Instruction Queue:** Decodes and aligns instructions, and can perform "macro-op fusion" (e.g., combining a compare and a conditional jump into a single micro-op).
    * **Decoders:** Translates complex x86 instructions (CISC) into simpler, fixed-length micro-operations (µops) that are easier for the backend to execute. Some simple x86 instructions can be decoded in a 1:1 fashion to µops, while more complex ones require a microcode sequencer to generate a sequence of µops.
    * **Micro-op Queue (µop Q):** A buffer holding decoded µops, providing a steady stream to the out-of-order engine.

2.  **Out-of-Order Engine (Execution Core):** This is the heart of performance in modern Intel CPUs, enabling dynamic scheduling and execution of µops to hide latencies and exploit instruction-level parallelism.
    * **Renamer/Allocator:** Renames architectural registers to a larger pool of physical registers to eliminate false dependencies (RAW, WAR, WAW hazards). It also allocates resources like reorder buffer (ROB) entries and load/store buffer entries.
    * **Scheduler/Issue Queue:** Buffers µops that are ready to execute (i.e., their operands are available). It dispatches µops to available execution ports.
    * **Reorder Buffer (ROB):** Tracks the original program order of µops, ensures correct retirement (writing results to architectural state in order), and handles exceptions and branch mispredictions.
    * **Execution Units (EUs):** These are the functional units that perform the actual operations. Intel i7 CPUs typically have multiple execution ports, each feeding specific types of EUs:
        * **Integer ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units):** For integer arithmetic and logical operations.
        * **Floating-Point Units (FPUs):** For floating-point arithmetic.
        * **Vector Units (e.g., AVX, AVX2, AVX-512):** These are critical for GEMM. Modern i7s support **AVX-512**, allowing for 512-bit wide vector operations, meaning they can process 8 double-precision (FP64) or 16 single-precision (FP32) floating-point numbers in a single instruction. CPUs may have two FMA (Fused Multiply-Add) units capable of performing both multiplication and addition in one instruction, which is highly beneficial for GEMM.
        * **Load/Store Units (LSUs):** Handle memory accesses (loads from cache/memory and stores to cache/memory). These units have their own queues (load buffer, store buffer) to manage memory operations.

3.  **Back-End:**
    * **Retirement Unit:** Commits the results of speculatively executed µops to the architectural state in program order, and frees up resources.

#### 1.2.1 Branch Prediction

Branch prediction is paramount for keeping the deep pipelines of modern CPUs filled. Intel i7s employ highly sophisticated, multi-level branch predictors, including a Branch Target Buffer (BTB) to predict the target address of branches and a Branch History Register (BHR) combined with Pattern History Tables (PHTs) to predict the direction (taken or not taken) of conditional branches. Mispredictions incur a significant penalty (e.g., 10-20 cycles), as the pipeline must be flushed and refilled with the correct instructions.

### 1.3 Cache Hierarchy and Memory Access

Intel i7 CPUs feature a multi-level cache hierarchy designed to reduce memory latency and improve data throughput, which is critical for data-intensive operations like GEMM.

* **L1 Cache (per core):** Each physical core has its own private L1 cache, split into:
    * **L1 Data Cache (L1d):** Typically 32 KB per core, 8-way set associative, with a very low latency (e.g., 4 cycles). This is the fastest cache level.
    * **L1 Instruction Cache (L1i):** Typically 32 KB per core.
    * L1 caches operate at core speed.

* **L2 Cache (per core):** Each physical core also has its own private L2 cache, unified for both instructions and data.
    * Size typically ranges from 256 KB to 1 MB per core, 8-way set associative.
    * Higher latency than L1 (e.g., 10-14 cycles) but significantly faster than L3 or main memory.

* **L3 Cache (Shared LLC - Last Level Cache):** This cache is shared among all physical cores on the CPU die.
    * Size varies widely, from 8 MB to 36 MB or more, and is highly associative (e.g., 16-way or more).
    * Higher latency than L2 (e.g., 35-50 cycles) but offers much higher capacity and acts as a victim cache for L1/L2 misses.
    * Crucially, data coherence is maintained through the L3 cache, ensuring all cores see a consistent view of memory.

* **Main Memory (DRAM):** Accessed via the integrated memory controller (IMC) on the CPU.
    * DDR4 or DDR5 support, with multiple channels (e.g., dual-channel, quad-channel).
    * Highest latency (hundreds of cycles) but largest capacity (GBs).

**Cache Coherence and Data Movement:** Data is moved between these cache levels and main memory in fixed-size blocks called cache lines (typically 64 bytes on x86 CPUs). When a core requests data, the cache hierarchy is checked from L1 to L3. If a cache miss occurs at L3, the data is fetched from main memory. Cache coherence protocols (e.g., MESI protocol) ensure that all cores have a consistent view of shared data, leading to snooping and cache invalidation traffic.

### 1.4 Vector Extensions (SIMD) for GEMM

Modern Intel i7 CPUs heavily rely on Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) extensions for high-performance computing tasks like GEMM. These extensions allow a single instruction to operate on multiple data elements simultaneously.

* **SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions):** Early SIMD extensions with 128-bit registers, capable of processing 4 single-precision floats or 2 double-precision floats at once.
* **AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions):** Introduced 256-bit registers, doubling the vector width, and added a non-destructive three-operand instruction format.
* **AVX2:** Built upon AVX, adding Fused Multiply-Add (FMA) instructions, which combine a multiplication and an addition into a single instruction (A * B + C), significantly boosting GEMM performance by reducing the number of instructions and increasing throughput. It also introduced gather operations.
* **AVX-512:** Found in some higher-end i7 and Xeon processors, this extends vector registers to 512 bits, enabling even greater parallelism (e.g., 16 single-precision or 8 double-precision floating-point operations per instruction). It also includes more flexible masking, gather/scatter operations, and new instruction sets for specific workloads. The presence of two 512-bit FMA units per core can theoretically achieve 32 FP32 or 16 FP64 floating-point operations per cycle per core.

### 1.5 Multi-Core and Interconnect

Intel i7 CPUs are multi-core processors. The cores communicate with each other and with the Last Level Cache (L3) via a high-speed on-die interconnect.

* **Ring Bus:** In older architectures (e.g., Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell), a ring interconnect connected cores, L3 cache slices, and the integrated memory controller (IMC). This allowed for relatively low-latency communication between cores and access to the shared L3.
* **Mesh Interconnect:** Newer high-core-count processors (e.g., Skylake-X and later high-end desktop/server CPUs) often employ a mesh interconnect. This provides a more scalable and efficient way to connect a large number of cores, L3 cache banks, memory controllers, and I/O hubs, by allowing data to travel shortest paths.

**Hyper-Threading (HT) Technology:** Intel HT Technology allows a single physical core to execute two independent threads concurrently. It achieves this by duplicating certain architectural state (e.g., registers, program counters) for each logical thread, while sharing most of the core's execution resources (e.g., execution units, caches). When one thread stalls (e.g., waiting for memory), the other thread can utilize the idle execution units, improving overall core utilization and throughput, especially for workloads with high instruction-level parallelism or memory-bound characteristics. For GEMM, it can help hide latency but might also compete for shared resources if both threads are compute-bound.

### 1.6 Power Management (Turbo Boost)

Intel Turbo Boost Technology allows the CPU to dynamically increase its clock frequency beyond its base frequency when operating conditions permit (i.e., within power, current, and thermal limits). This can provide a significant performance boost for both single-threaded and multi-threaded workloads, including GEMM. The degree of boost depends on the number of active cores and the type of workload. Heavy AVX workloads, such as highly optimized GEMM, often trigger lower maximum turbo frequencies due to their higher power consumption compared to non-AVX workloads.
