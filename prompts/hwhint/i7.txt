For GEMM, **cache blocking (tiling)** is a fundamental optimization technique. By dividing large matrices into smaller blocks that fit within the L1, L2, and L3 caches, the algorithm can maximize data reuse and reduce expensive main memory accesses. The goal is to perform as many computations as possible on data already present in faster cache levels. Specifically, the L1 data cache and vector units are paramount for achieving peak performance.
Optimized GEMM kernels heavily utilize these AVX instructions, particularly FMA, to perform multiple multiplications and additions in parallel.
