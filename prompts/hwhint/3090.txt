### 5. Optimizing GEMM Operations on RTX 3090

GEMM (General Matrix Multiplication) is a fundamental operation in many scientific computing and deep learning workloads. Optimizing it on the RTX 3090 involves leveraging its architecture:

* **Tiling and Shared Memory:**
    * Break down large matrix multiplications into smaller "tiles" or sub-matrices.
    * Load these tiles into shared memory (which is much faster than global memory) for threads within a block. This drastically reduces global memory accesses, exploiting data locality.
    * Perform the matrix multiplication on the tiles in shared memory.
    * Synchronize threads with `__syncthreads()` after loading tiles to ensure all threads have the necessary data before computation.
    * Write the results back to global memory.
* **Coalesced Memory Access:**
    * Ensure that global memory accesses by threads within a warp are "coalesced," meaning they access contiguous memory locations. This allows the memory controller to serve multiple requests with a single transaction, maximizing memory bandwidth.
* **Minimize Warp Divergence:**
    * Design kernels so that threads within a warp follow the same execution path as much as possible. Conditional statements should be avoided or structured to minimize divergence.
* **Leverage Tensor Cores:**
    * For matrix multiplications involving data types supported by Tensor Cores (e.g., FP16, TF32, INT8), utilize the Tensor Core instructions (via CUDA's WMMA API or high-level libraries like cuBLAS, cuDNN). Tensor Cores are specifically designed for these operations and offer significantly higher throughput.
* **Occupancy Optimization:**
    * Tune the number of threads per block and the amount of shared memory and registers used per thread to achieve high SM occupancy. This ensures that the GPU has enough active warps to hide latency. Too many registers or too much shared memory per thread block can limit the number of active blocks/warps per SM, reducing occupancy.
* **Asynchronous Operations and Streams:**
    * Overlap computation with data transfers using CUDA streams. For example, while one kernel is computing on a set of data, the next set of data can be asynchronously transferred from host to device memory or from global memory to shared memory for a subsequent kernel.
    * Utilize hardware-accelerated asynchronous copy engines (like the Tensor Memory Accelerator - TMA in newer architectures, though Ampere has strong asynchronous copy capabilities).
* **Memory Paging and Residency:**
    * Understand the behavior of the L2 cache and its residency management features. For data that is frequently reused across multiple kernel launches or phases, mechanisms to hint to the driver to keep it resident in L2 can improve performance.
