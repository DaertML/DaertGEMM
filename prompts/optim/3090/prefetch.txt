# GEMM Optimizations on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU

## 2\. Prefetch Optimization

**Platform-Agnostic Description:**
Prefetching aims to bring data into faster memory (like shared memory or L1 cache) *before* it's explicitly requested by compute units, thereby hiding memory latency and keeping the processing units busy. This overlaps computation with memory transfers.

**Platform-Specific Hint (NVIDIA RTX 3090):**
On the RTX 3090, the primary explicit prefetching mechanism is loading data into **shared memory**. This is programmer-managed cache that is extremely fast (much faster than L1/L2 cache for global memory). Asynchronous memory operations (`cudaMemcpyAsync`, or specialized instructions within kernels) are also key for overlapping data movement with computation.

**Implementation (Conceptual CUDA C++ Kernel Snippet):**

```cu
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Assume TILE_M, TILE_N, TILE_K are defined block dimensions
// and register tile dimensions (e.g., WARP_M, WARP_N)

__global__ void gemm_prefetch_kernel(float* C, const float* A, const float* B, int M, int N, int K) {
    // Shared memory for blocks of A and B
    __shared__ float sA[TILE_M][TILE_K];
    __shared__ float sB[TILE_K][TILE_N];

    // Register accumulators for the C tile computed by this thread
    // This example uses a single float for simplicity, but in reality it's a matrix fragment
    float C_frag = 0.0f; 

    // Global indices for the thread
    int globalRow = blockIdx.y * TILE_M + threadIdx.y;
    int globalCol = blockIdx.x * TILE_N + threadIdx.x;

    // Loop through the K dimension in blocks
    for (int k_outer = 0; k_outer < K; k_outer += TILE_K) {
        // Asynchronously load A and B tiles into shared memory
        // This is done by threads within the block collaborating.
        // Each thread calculates its specific element to load.

        // Load element for sA
        // Make sure to handle boundary conditions
        if (globalRow < M && (k_outer + threadIdx.x) < K) { // Example: threadIdx.x for column, threadIdx.y for row
            sA[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = A[globalRow * K + (k_outer + threadIdx.x)];
        } else {
            sA[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = 0.0f; // Pad with zeros
        }

        // Load element for sB
        if ((k_outer + threadIdx.y) < K && globalCol < N) { // Example: threadIdx.y for row, threadIdx.x for column
            sB[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = B[(k_outer + threadIdx.y) * N + globalCol];
        } else {
            sB[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = 0.0f; // Pad with zeros
        }

        // Synchronize threads within the block to ensure all data is loaded into shared memory
        __syncthreads();

        // Perform computation using data from shared memory
        // This simulates a smaller matrix multiplication
        for (int k_inner = 0; k_inner < TILE_K; ++k_inner) {
            // Access shared memory: sA[row_in_tile][k_inner], sB[k_inner][col_in_tile]
            // The actual computation will depend on register blocking strategy
            C_frag += sA[threadIdx.y][k_inner] * sB[k_inner][threadIdx.x];
        }

        // Synchronize again before the next outer loop iteration to ensure
        // all computation using the current shared memory tile is done
        // before new data is loaded into shared memory.
        __syncthreads();
    }

    // Write final accumulated result from register to global memory
    if (globalRow < M && globalCol < N) {
        C[globalRow * N + globalCol] = C_frag;
    }
}
```

*Key Prefetching Aspect:* The loading into `sA` and `sB` occurs in parallel for all threads in a block. While the previous `k_outer` iteration's computation is ongoing (within the `C_frag += ...` loop), the next tile's data could theoretically be preloaded by a dedicated copy engine or by clever double-buffering. The `__syncthreads()` ensures data readiness. More advanced prefetching uses **double buffering** (loading the next tile into a separate shared memory buffer while processing the current one) and **asynchronous shared memory copies** (e.g., `async_copy_global_to_shared` intrinsics on newer architectures like Ampere/Hopper for even better overlap).
