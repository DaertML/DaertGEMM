# DaertGEMM
Open source implementation of the QiMeng-GEMM: https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/34461/36616

# Introduction
WIP Implementation! Yet lots of work are pending, somehow the base ideas are there. With this, DaertML looks forward completing as an Open Source ecosystem the ideas from the QiMeng works that have been recently published (and most of them Open Sourced) https://qimeng-ict.github.io/

# Run
"python3 auto_tuner.py" should be enough; only ollama is needed as a dependency (and it could be scraped for simple REST calls).

# TODO
The main objective is to reproduce the results from the aforementioned papers, and potentially try to get a certain improvement.
